# Java Implementation of Data Structures

This repository consists of various lab folders from a Data Structures 
and Algorithms course I took as an undergrad. Each folder is designed to 
implement (in Java) specific data structures and algorithms. Below is a 
description of each lab folder and the corresponding data 
structure(s) implemented in it:

## Lab1

### Data Structures Implemented
- **RecursiveMethods**: This lab folder is dedicated to recursive methods. 
It includes classes and code related to recursion and recursive 
algorithms.

## Lab2

### Data Structures Implemented
- **YorkArrayList**: This lab focuses on implementing an ArrayList, a 
dynamic array data structure that can dynamically resize itself.
- **IntTester**: This class is for testing integer-related operations, 
likely for evaluating the functionality of the YorkArrayList.

## Lab3

### Data Structures Implemented
- **YorkLinkedList**: Lab3 is centered around the creation of a linked 
list data structure, an essential building block for various applications.
- **List**: This lab includes interfaces and classes related to lists, 
providing a foundational structure for linked list operations.
- **TimeComplexity**: A class within this lab is designed for measuring 
the time complexity of operations, helping to analyze the efficiency of 
the data structure.

## Lab4

### Data Structures Implemented
- **YorkArrayQueue**: Lab4 is devoted to implementing an array-based 
queue, a fundamental data structure for managing data in a first-in, 
first-out (FIFO) manner.
- **YorkArrayStack**: This section focuses on creating an array-based 
stack, an essential tool for managing data in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) 
manner.
- **YorkQueueUsingStacks**: This lab explores the implementation of a 
queue using stacks, offering insights into algorithmic design.

## Lab5

### Data Structures Implemented
- **YorkSortedDoublyLinkedList**: Lab5 involves creating a sorted doubly 
linked list, a versatile data structure used for efficient data 
organization and retrieval.
- **List**: Similar to Lab3, this lab includes interfaces and classes 
related to lists, providing a basis for the YorkSortedDoublyLinkedList 
operations.

## Lab6

### Data Structures Implemented
- **YorkUnsortedMap**: This lab focuses on implementing an unsorted map, a 
data structure that associates keys with values for efficient data 
retrieval.
- **Map**: The lab includes interfaces and classes related to maps, 
providing a structure for map-related operations.

## Lab78

### Data Structures Implemented
- **YorkBinarySearchTree**: Lab78 is dedicated to the implementation of a 
binary search tree, a hierarchical data structure that allows for 
efficient data search and retrieval.
- **YorkBinaryTree**: This section includes classes related to a general 
binary tree, providing the foundational structure for the binary search 
tree.
- **YorkLinkedBinaryTree**: Classes for a linked binary tree 
implementation.
- **Tree**: The lab includes interfaces and classes related to trees, 
providing a basis for tree-related operations and algorithms.
